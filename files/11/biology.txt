How do living things aquire energy?! !Humans/Animals aquire energy through food, oxygen and water and through cellular respiration CO2, H2O, and ATP (adenosine triphosphate). Animals get energy from the food which is glucose (sugar), and carbohydrates are large chains of glucose. Animals cannot get energy from the sun directly. Plants on the otherhand get energy from photosynthesis by obtaining sunlight and water.! !What does it mean for living thigns to maintain a relatively constant internal environment?! !This means all organisms have to keep an internal temperature that fits them. In humans this is around 37 °C. Fevers affect this and so does working out. Trees for example can survive the winter because they maintain a higher internal temperature so the water does not freeze inside of them.! !How are living things organized and what does it mean to be unicellular and multicellular and give examples?! !Living things have various levels of biological organization. In Biology, cells are the smallest units that show the characteristics of life. Cells are more specialized in advanced species like humans and mammals. They contain structures called organelles that allow the cell to do more. Animals without backbones are less specially organized. Unicellular are single celled organisms and they are not advanced. Amoeba's are examples of unicellular organisms. Multicellular means having more than one cell and humans, dogs, cats, and mouse are all examples. In biology, organisms with a higher level of organization (ex. large mammals) have different tissue levels. These animals are more successful in the wild and are able to survive.! !What is food?! !Glucose! !What are large chains of glucose called?! !Carbohydrates! !What does ATP mean?! !Adenosine Triphosphate! !What types of organisms get energy from the sun?! !Plants! !What is the average human temperature?! !37 °C! !What are the smallest units of life?! !Cells! !What shows the characteristics of life?! !cells! !How are more advanced species specialized?! !Organelles! !What does organnels allow for a cell?! !The cell can perform more.! !What is unicellular?! !Single celled organisms and they are not advanced.! !What is multicellular?! !More than one cell.! !What is an example of unicellular?! !Amoeba! !What is an example of multicellular?! !Humans! !What do organisms with higher levels of organization have?! !They have different tissue levels.! !What is beneficial of having higher levels of organization?! !These organisms are more successful in the wild and they are able to survive.
