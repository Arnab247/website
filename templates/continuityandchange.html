        <p>Since this bike trip, my definition of a far bike ride has changed. Before, I used to think previous locations I have biked to, such as the airport or The Forks, to be far places. Now, I consider these places to be nearby. Since this event, I also changed how I tackle goals in my life. In the previous section, I mentioned how we would celebrate after biking just 2km. Something similar I do with goals in life now is pre-define small set goals and once I reach the goals I do reward myself with a small break, or treat. These goals are not too small that I do not make any progress, but these broken down goals are smaller than how I used to previously tackle goals and this leads me to accomplish goals much faster. For example, I took a deep learning course over the summer which I wanted to complete in a week. There were 2.5 months of material to cover (at a pace of about 1 hour per day). Thinking of a whole picture, this seemed impossible to me at the start. However, after each section I completed, which took about 1h each, I rewarded myself to watching a few minutes of anime, and to my surprise, by the end of the week, I ended up completing the course. <br>
        <br>
        As a result of this event, my love for biking, however, did not change. Before biking, and after, I love how much freedom my bike gives for me to explore the world around me. A lot of people may think that because of all the struggles my friends and I had to go through when biking to Stonewall, that we would not want to ride on a bike again. This was not the case. When going to Stonewall, even though there were many obstacles against us, I loved every bit of the way.
