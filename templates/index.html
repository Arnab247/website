        <p>This moment is significant in my life today because it is a moment when I left my comfort zone and challenged myself to accomplish something difficult. Battling the wind was no easy task. The friction from biking on gravel also made the situation worse. This event helped define me as a person because it has made me believe that I am capable of much more than what I think I can do. When biking to Stonewall, since the wind was so strong, we were motivated by creating a bunch of small goals. We would celebrate after biking just 2km. We were all sharing the same struggles and this created a sense that we were all connected. From this, I learned that all we need to move forward in life is a little motivation and the right environment. </p>

        <p>This is a picture of my friends and me when we entered Stonewall. To prove we biked there, you can see Garry, my friend at the right with the orange shirt is wearing a helmet. (My helmet was on my bike handle, and so was for two of my other friends.) The helmet strap is visible. You can also see that we biked to stonewall recently because Sami, my friend beside Garry with the black hoodie, is wearing a mask. The "Welcome to Stonewall" sign is a landmark on the picture indicating that this image was taken at the entrance of Stonewall. This picture also shows that I biked with my friends as the clothing and backpack I am wearing on the picture is an outfit I wear to school. Another note to indicate it was me and we biked is if you look at my hand at the bottom left corner, my veins become more visible, which happens to me when working hard and sweating.</p>

        <p>This is another picture from the day of the event at the same location. You can tell from the grass and the power lines. You could also see that this is the same spot because if you look at the road, it does not lead into any town while if the picture was taken from the other side, the the "Welcome to Stonewall" landmark would have been spotted, as well as the buildings at the entrance of stonewall. The tone of the image is a bit different because this picture was taken from my phone while the previous image was a selfie taken on Garry's phone. This image also shows our bikes behind Gordan, my friend with the white shirt. He is stretching because of how sore his muscles from biking so far. My friend Sami, is laying down beacuse of how tired he was, furthur providing evidence that we biked to Stonewall.</p>

            On the way to Stonewall, we struggled to get there because of the strong winds. This also increased how tired we were. Historical Saved Data can be used to proove that the wind speed was high on the day we went. If you look under the wind speed column, you can see that the wind went up to 40kmph.  This was painful while biking, especially in the open prarie. Unfortunately, historical wind speeds were not recorded at the Stonewall area.</p>

    <div class="continuityandchange"><h2>Continuity and Change</h2></div>
    <div class="continuityandchangetext">
        <p>Since this bike trip, my definition of a far bike ride has changed. Before, I used to think previous locations I have biked to, such as the airport or The Forks, to be far places. Now, I consider these places to be nearby. Since this event, I also changed how I tackle goals in my life. In the previous section, I mentioned how we would celebrate after biking just 2km. Something similar I do with goals in life now is pre-define small set goals and once I reach the goals I do reward myself with a small break, or treat. These goals are not too small that I do not make any progress, but these broken down goals are smaller than how I used to previously tackle goals and this leads me to accomplish goals much faster. For example, I took a deep learning course over the summer which I wanted to complete in a week. There were 2.5 months of material to cover (at a pace of about 1 hour per day). Thinking of a whole picture, this seemed impossible to me at the start. However, after each section I completed, which took about 1h each, I rewarded myself to watching a few minutes of anime, and to my surprise, by the end of the week, I ended up completing the course. <br>
        <br>
        As a result of this event, my love for biking, however, did not change. Before biking, and after I love how much freedom my bike gives for me to explore the world around me. A lot of people may think that because of all the struggles my friends and I had to go through when biking to Stonewall, that we would not want to ride on a bike again. This was not the case. When going to Stonewall, even though there were many obstacles against us, I loved every bit of the way.

    <div class="causeandconsequence"><h2>Cause and Consequence</h2></div>
    <div class="causeandconsequencetext">
        <p>This event was caused because my friends and I wanted to do something somewhat big after we finished all our assessments of our grade 10 year. We all loved biking so we were planning on a biking trip to go to somewhere. As a joke, I mentioned that we should go to Stonewall and surprisingly my friend took it seriously and we ended up all agreeing to go. My consequence I faced on my life after this event was that I missed going to a restaurant that my parents and another family planned on getting together. The food would have been good too which I was looking forward to when my friends and I got back. However, my friends and I got back at 11pm because we wanted to stay at Stonewall for a bit longer, so I missed the outing.

    </h2></div>
    <div class="ethicaldimensionstext">
        <p>One important lesson that was learned as a result of this event is that planning is very important. When my friends and I went, we completely disregarded the weather. All we made sure was that the day would not be a rainy day. We would have been aware of the wind if we checked earlier. Next time if this event were to happen again, we would look ahead and make sure the weather suits certain conditions. We would plan a day where the wind would not be too strong, and the temperature would not be too hot. The wind increased the time it took us significantly and that would not have happened under better conditions.
